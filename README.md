# SHAPE Summer Session 2, Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence
## Summer High School Academic Program for Engineers
## Columbia Unviersity, Summer 2025

AI systems like ChatGPT, other language models, and computer vision systems are becoming a big part of our everyday lives. But how do these systems actually work? What can they do, and where do they fall short?

This crash course in machine learning and AI will introduce you to the basics. You’ll start with simpler machine learning models, learn about neural networks and image classification models, and explore how advanced models like ChatGPT are built and trained.

**Who is this course for?** Students who are comfortable with basic coding in any language (like Java or Python).
