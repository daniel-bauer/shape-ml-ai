# SHAPE Summer Session 2, Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence
## Summer High School Academic Program for Engineers
## Columbia University, Summer 2025

AI systems like ChatGPT, other language models, and computer vision systems are becoming a big part of our everyday lives. But how do these systems actually work? What can they do, and where do they fall short?

This crash course in machine learning and AI will introduce you to the basics. You’ll start with simpler machine learning models, learn about neural networks and image classification models, and explore how advanced models like ChatGPT are built and trained.

**Who is this course for?** Students who are comfortable with basic coding in any language (like Java or Python).

#### Teaching Staff

Instructor: [Daniel Bauer](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~bauer)  
Summer Student Leaders: Batu Yeltekin, Michael Del Toro, Leo Zubarev

**Location:** **Botwinick Lab - Mudd 1224**

#### **What you Will Learn**

*   A quick review of Python
*   Important math concepts: basic calculus and working with vectors and matrices
*   How to handle different types of data, including tables, images, and text
*   How neural networks work and learn from data
*   How to classify images using Convolutional Neural Networks
*   How to represent words in a way that computers understand
*   How transformers (a type of ML model) work
*   The basics of models like GPT
*   How pretraining and fine-tuning make these models smarter
*   How to interact with language models using prompts and API calls
